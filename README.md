# DTM-17
Theme that brings back the 2017/2018 look of Discord.

All issues should go here (and please use the dtm-17 label) -> https://github.com/XYZenix/XYZenixThemes/issues


## Features
- Doesn't remove functionality
- Hopefully will *eventually* support all settings (language, dark/light, dark sidebar, all accessibility features, and so on)

## Preview
N/A (will add later)
